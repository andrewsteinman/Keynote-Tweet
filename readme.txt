In order for the script to work, you'll need to install and configure twurl. You can find the twurl download and documentation here:

    http://github.com/marcel/twurl

To run the script, simply double-click the Keynote Tweet 2 icon. To edit it, open the same file in AppleScript Editor (formerly Script Editor). Note that you cannot run this or any 'Stay-Open' script from the editor, but must run it as an application instead.
